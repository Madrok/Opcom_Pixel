The Opcom Neo\+Pixel Library is a stateful library for running light shows on the Adafruit Neo\+Pixels, or any pixel strip. Within the physical strip, multiple logical panels can be created and run independent lighting effects, turning your one strip into a highly configurable lighting platform.

\section*{Installation }

The \doxyref{Adafruit\+\_\+\+Neo\+Pixel}{p.}{class_adafruit___neo_pixel} library is included in this distribution, so you will not need to install it seperately. Download the library, unzip, rename the folder to \char`\"{}\+Opcom\+\_\+\+Pixel\char`\"{} and move it to your Arduino libraries folder. After a restart of the Arduino I\+D\+E, open File-\/$>$Sketchbook-\/$>$Library-\/$>$Opcom\+\_\+\+Pixel-\/$>$paneltest sketch. Change the definitions for P\+I\+N and N\+U\+M\+P\+I\+X\+E\+L\+S and upload.

The following products should work with the library, as per the included \doxyref{Adafruit\+\_\+\+Neo\+Pixel}{p.}{class_adafruit___neo_pixel} library.
