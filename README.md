Opcom Pixel library
======================

The Opcom NeoPixel Library is a stateful library for running light shows on the Adafruit NeoPixels, or any
pixel strip. Within the physical strip, multiple logical panels can be created and run independent lighting
effects, turning your one strip into a highly configurable lighting platform.


Installation
============

The Adafruit_NeoPixel library is included in this distribution, so you will not need to install it seperately.
Download the library, unzip, rename the folder to "Opcom_Pixel" and move it to your Arduino libraries folder.
After a restart of the Arduino IDE, open File->Sketchbook->Library->Opcom_Pixel->paneltest sketch. Change the
definitions for PIN and NUMPIXELS and upload.

The following products should work with the library, as per the included Adafruit_NeoPixel library.
